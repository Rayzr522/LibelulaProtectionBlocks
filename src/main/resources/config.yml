# About editing this file:
# * Don't edit this file if you aren't sure about what are you doing.
# * Don't use tabs, this is a yaml file so you have to use spaces instead.
# * Don't get rid of the indents. They are indented so some entries are
#   in categories (like "configurable-flags" is in the "player" category.
# * If you want to check the format of this file before putting it
#   into this plugin, paste it into http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/
#   and see if it gives "ERROR:".
# * Lines starting with # are commentsand so they are ignored.
